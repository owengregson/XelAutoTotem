<p>All in one "legit" automatic totem management & swapping mod for Fabric Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h2>Download the latest version from the Releases tab, or by clicking <a href="https://github.com/owengregson/XelAutoTotem/releases/latest">here!</a></h2>
<h2>Requires <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu">ModMenu</a> version 11.0.1 or later.</h2>
<br>
<p>I was inspired to create this project because most other auto-totem solutions are either very obvious, require using an entire utility client, or are outdated/buggy and do not work properly. XAT is the solution for users wanting to discreetly use auto-totem in modern Minecraft.</p>

<p>XelAutoTotem features realistic mouse movement, packet switching, and customizable randomized delays. In addition, it boasts the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parabolic Arc Mouse Movement</li>
<li>Simulates realistic movement between default gui open position and the closest totem slot to the offhand. In the future, when this feature is even more refined, this will make the client screenshare-proof.</li>
<li>Legit Swap</li>
<li>Swap totems into the hotbar and then swap into the offhand (this is the technique used by most pro players, and will make you seem like you are just a really good player, not using a mod.)</li>
<li>Hotbar Filler</li>
<li>Integrate with the aforementioned feature to automatically fill the hotbar's empty slots with totems when popping. Falls back to inventory swapping if the hotbar is full.</li>
<li>Random Delay and Delay Distribution</li>
<li>Randomly calculate delay based on your configuration and evenly split the delay to all the movements. Allows for more resilient swapping that is not as vulnerable to lag and ping-related issues.</li>
<li>Packet Swap</li>
<li>You may choose to swap totems with packets and never even open the inventory client-sided. This is considered "rage" mode. Still uses safe methods that can bypass most anticheats (DonutSMP, USPvP, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of these features are configurable</strong>, so you can enable, disable, and change them to your liking.</p>
